# Assignment 1 The Sokoban Puzzle
Implement a program to solve Sokoban puzzles.

The basic heuristic function used in this task is the Manhattam distance heuristic. However, I also developed an admissible advanced heuristic function that dominates the Manhattan distance heuristic.

# Assignment 2 The Mancala Game
Implement a program to play the Mancala game.

In this task, I also developed an advanced heuristic function, that is used as the bottom player agent in a game, where the top player agent is using the basic heuristic function. The bottom player is tested to have a win rate greater than 50%, and the rate is increased as the size of the game enlarges.

# Assignment 3 The Kropki Sudoku Puzzle
Implement a program to solve the Kropki Sudoku puzzles (6x6 and 9x9) using the knowledge of CSP.

# Assignment 4 Bayes Net
Apply the Variable Elimination Algorithm(VEA) predict the salaries of people who lived in the United States in 1994 by using a variety of attributes. The process includes creating a Naive Bayes model to represent the relationships between peopleâ€™s salaries and their other attributes such as race, gender, education level, etc. And then implement and use the VEA to calculate probabilities and make salary predictions.

Explored questions:
What percentage of the women in the test data set does our model predict having a salary >= $50K? 
What percentage of the men in the test data set does our model predict having a salary >= $50K?
What percentage of the women in the test data set satisfies the condition: P(Salary=">=$50K" | Evidence) > P(Salary=">=$50K" | Evidence, Gender)
What percentage of the men in the test data set satisfies the condition: P(Salary=">=$50K"|E) > P(Salary=">=$50K"|E, Gender)?
What percentage of the women in the test data set with a predicted salary over $50K (P(Salary=">=$50K"|E) > 0.5) have an actual salary over $50K?
What percentage of the men in the test data set with a predicted salary over $50K (P(Salary=">=$50K"|E) > 0.5) have an actual salary over $50K?
